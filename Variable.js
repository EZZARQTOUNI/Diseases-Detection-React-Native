Languages["en"]["article"]["desc"]["1"]='There are at least a dozen advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed. These advantages result in a higher quality of life, less stress for family care partners, more time to treasure the present, and increased time for future planning.'
+
'\n\n\t1. Your symptoms might be reversible\n'
+'Potential symptoms may be caused by a condition that is reversible. If there is an underlying dementia such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, then diagnosis and treatment of reversible conditions can improve brain function and reduce symptoms.'
+'\n\n\t2. It may be treatable\n'
+'Some causes of cognitive decline are not reversible. However, they might be treatable. Appropriate treatment can stop or slow the rate of further decline.'
+'\n\n\t3. Time is of the essence\n'
+'Alzheimer‚Äôs and other dementia-causing diseases are typically most effective when started early in the disease process. An early and accurate diagnosis is crucial‚Äîespecially as research leads to robust treatment options.'
+'\n\n\t4. Diagnoses are more accurate early in the disease process\n'
+'An accurate diagnosis is contingent upon a complete medical. The latter often is more easily obtained while the person is still able to answer questions and report concerns. Also, observers in early stages can still recall the order in which symptoms first appeared. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis can be difficult once most of the brain has become affected.'
+'\n\n\t5. An early diagnosis is empowering\n'
+'An earlier diagnosis enables the person to participate in their own legal, financial, and long-term care planning and to make their wishes known to family members.'
+'\n\n\t6. You can focus on what‚Äôs important to you\n'
+'An early diagnosis enables the person to prioritize how they spend their time‚Äîfocusing on what matters most to them.'
+'\n\n\t7. You can make your best choices\n'
+'Early diagnosis can prevent choices that might otherwise be made in ignorance, such as moving far away from family and friends, or making legal or financial commitments that will be hard to keep as the disease progresses.'
+'\n\n\t8. Use the resources available to you\n'
+'Individuals diagnosed early in the disease process can take advantage of early-stage support groups and learn tips and strategies to better manage and cope with the symptoms.'
+'\n\n\t9. Participate or advocate for research\n'
+'Those diagnosed early can take advantage of clinical trials or advocate for more research and improved care and opportunities.'
+'\n\n\t10. You can further people‚Äôs understanding of the disease\n'
+'Early diagnosis helps to reduce the stigma associated with the disease. When we learn to associate the disease with people in the early stages, we understand they are still viable in the community.'
+'\n\n\t11. An early diagnosis will help your family\n'
+'An early diagnosis gives families more opportunities to learn about the disease, develop realistic expectations, and plan for their future together. Often, this process results in reduced stress and lessened feelings of burden and regret later in the disease process.'
+'\n\n\t12. The early diagnosis helps loved ones\n'
+'Early diagnosis allows the person and family to attribute cognitive changes to the disease rather than to personal failings ‚Äîpreserving the person‚Äôs dignity throughout the disease process.'

Languages["en"]["article"]["title"]["3"]='Benefits of Artificial Intelligence';
Languages["en"]["article"]["desc"]["3"]='Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for quite some time now. From quick suggestions on search engines and auto-focus in smartphones to robot greeters at shopping centers and vehicle cruise control, AI is increasingly becoming a part of our day-to-day lives. The scope for innovation and development in AI is enormous and it will continue changing the world in diverse ways in the future.\nBelow are the 10 most remarkable benefits of Artificial Intelligence that are helping to reshape the world that we know of today.'
+'\n\n\t1. Automation \n'
+'Automation is one of the most commonly cited benefits of AI technology, and it has had significant impacts on the communications, transportation, consumer products, and service industries. Automation not just leads to higher production rates and increased productivity in these sectors but also allows more efficient use of raw materials, improved product quality, reduced lead times, and superior safety. Automation can also help to free resources that can be used for more important things.'
+'\n\n\t2. Smart Decision Making \n'
+'Artificial Intelligence has always been used for making smarter business decisions. AI technology can coordinate data delivery, analyze trends, develop data consistency, provide forecasts, and quantify uncertainties to make the best decisions for the company. As long as AI is not programmed to imitate human emotions, it will remain unbiased on the matter at hand and will help to make the right decision to support business efficiency.'
+'\n\n\t3. Enhanced Customer Experience\n'
+'AI-powered solutions can help businesses to respond to customer queries and grievances quickly and address the situations efficiently. The use of chatbots that couple conversational AI with Natural Language Processing technology can generate highly personalized messages for customers, which helps to find the best solution for their needs. AI tools can also help to reduce the strain from the customer service staff, which will lead to better productivity.'
+'\n\n\t4. Medical Advances\n'
+'The use of Artificial Intelligence solutions in the healthcare sector is becoming increasingly popular these days. Remote patient monitoring technology, for instance, allows healthcare providers to perform clinical diagnoses and suggest treatments quickly without requiring the patient to visit the hospital in-person. AI can also be beneficial in monitoring the progression of contagious diseases and even predict their future effects and outcomes.'
+'\n\n\t5. Research and Data Analysis\n'
+'AI and Machine Learning technology can be used to analyze data much more efficiently. It can help to create predictive models and algorithms to process data and understand the potential outcomes of different trends and scenarios. Moreover, the advanced computing capabilities of AI can also speed up the processing and analysis of data for research and development, which could have taken too long for humans to review and understand.'
+'\n\n\t6. Solving Complex Problems\n'
+'The developments in AI technologies from basic Machine Learning to advanced Deep Learning models have made it capable to solve complex issues. From fraud detection and personalized customer interactions to weather forecasting and medical diagnosis, AI is helping businesses across industries to find the right solutions to address their challenges more adequately. Greater efficiency in solving complex problems means increased productivity and reduced expenses.'
+'\n\n\t7. Business Continuity\n'
+'Business forecasting using AI technology not only helps companies make critical decisions but also prepares them for any emergency to ensure business continuity. As risk management heavily relies on data management and analysis today, AI-powered tools can help organizations to respond to the crisis proactively. AI and Machine Learning can also create scenarios to help businesses plan for a speedy disaster recovery strategy.'
+'\n\n\t8. Managing Repetitive Tasks\n'
+'Performing recurring business tasks is not just time-consuming but it can also be monotonous and reduce the productivity of the employees over time. AI-powered Robotic Process Automation tools can automate interactions between different business systems and make the tiresome work easy for the company. It can imitate the actions of humans within the digital systems in the HR, IT, marketing, or sales departments to execute any business process quickly without needing any manual effort.'
+'\n\n\t9. Minimizing Errors\n'
+'Another great benefit of automating regular business tasks using AI tools is that it helps to reduce the chances of manual errors. As Robotic Process Automation tools take care of the data entry and processing jobs, it can make the digital systems more efficient and less likely to run into or create any problems due to data processing mistakes. This can be especially beneficial for businesses that cannot afford to make even the slightest of errors.'
+'\n\n\t10. Increased Business Efficiency\n'
+'Artificial Intelligence can help to ensure 24-hour service availability and will deliver the same performance and consistency throughout the day. Taking care of repetitive tasks will not make AI tools get tired or bored either. This can help to improve the efficiency of the business and reduce the stress on the employees, who can be re-assigned to perform more complex business tasks that require manual intervention.';
